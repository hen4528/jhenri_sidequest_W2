## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han
Changes made by Jasmine Henri to javascript code with the use of the visual code Chatbot

## Description

With the Chatbot on visual studio changes were made to the yellow platform when it's being jumped on, when the blob jumps in the air on the platforms it's colour is randomzized, when it returns to the ground it turns back to neutral. When the blob is in the air the background turns blue and when the blob is back on the ground the background returns back to neutral. This addition of colour demonstrates the excitement the blob feels to be playing the game and in the air.
