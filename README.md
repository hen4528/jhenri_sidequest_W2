## Project Title
Side Quest 2 - Adding Blobs Expressions
---

## Description

I worked with the chatbot to add colours to represent emotion of the blob in the game:
- When the blob goes on a platform it turns yellow to demonstrate joy
- When the blob isn't on the ground and is jumping around on platforms it is set to a randomized colour to  represent excitement and happiness versus boredeom when it's back on the ground
- When the blob is on the platforms the background colour turns light blue (like the sky) to represent a positive shift in emotion now that the blob is on the platform

## Interaction Instructions

This is a fun, entertainment game where users can change the colour of the blob, the background and the platforms by interacting with the blobs movements. Users will use the keys to make the blob move from the ground to each platform and the colours will automatically change as each element is interacted with and triggered. When the blob is in the air, the background colour (sky) will get brighter, when the blob jumps on platforms the platform changes and so does the blob's colour. Making for an interactive experience with colour change that demonstrates emotions.

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane and David Han 
Edits made by Jasmine Henri and the help of visual studio's ChatBot

These features used GenAI to ajdust and add more coding to the sketch.js through the chatbot built into visual studio code
- The platform change
- The blob colour change 
- Readjusting the code and making changes to order the execution of the background colour change so it didn't disrupt the blob colour change in the draw function
