## Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

I worked with the chatbot to add colours to represent emotion of the blob in the game:
- When the blob goes on a platform it turns yellow to demonstrate joy
- When the blob isn't on the ground and is jumping around on platforms it is set to a randomized colour to  represent excitement and happiness versus boredeom when it's back on the ground
- When the blob is on the platforms the background colour turns light blue (like the sky) to represent a positive shift in emotion now that the blob is on the platform
---

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

- Redesign the blob’s movement and environment to express a specific emotion

=======
With the Chatbot on visual studio changes were made to the yellow platform when it's being jumped on, when the blob jumps in the air on the platforms it's colour is randomzized, when it returns to the ground it turns back to neutral. When the blob is in the air the background turns blue and when the blob is back on the ground the background returns back to neutral. This addition of colour demonstrates the excitement the blob feels to be playing the game and in the air.

Changes made by Jasmine Henri to javascript code with the use of the visual code Chatbot

## GenAI

GenAI was used for this assignment, the javascript chatbot


<<<<<<< HEAD
These features used GenAI to ajdust and add more coding to the sketch.js through the chatbot built into visual studio code
- The platform change
- The blob colour change 
- Readjusting the code and making changes to order the execution of the background colour change so it didn't disrupt the blob colour change in the draw function
